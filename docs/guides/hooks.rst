Machine Learning Hooks
======================

.. note::

        This page covers the ML detection pipeline, which is required for **both**
        Path 1 (detection only) and Path 2 (full ES).
        For installation instructions, see :doc:`installation`.
        The hooks use `pyzm <https://pyzmv2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ v2
        for detection. Make sure you have ``pyzm`` installed before proceeding.

.. important::

        Setting up hooks requires familiarity with the Linux command line, Python
        package management, and basic troubleshooting. Support is not provided for
        general environment issues (e.g. missing ``pip3``, ``cv2`` import errors).
        The hooks are provided as-is.


Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Detection: objects, faces
- Recognition: faces
- License plate recognition (ALPR) via cloud services
- Audio recognition: bird species identification via BirdNET
- Platforms:

   - CPU (object, face detection, face recognition),
   - GPU (object, face detection, face recognition),
   - EdgeTPU (object, face detection)

- Machine learning can run locally or remotely via ``pyzm.serve``

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV 4.13+ (for the default ONNX YOLO models)
- pyzm v2 (``pip install pyzm``)

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main detection script is ``zm_detect.py``. It reads ``objectconfig.yml``,
connects to ZoneMinder, downloads event frames, runs the ML detection pipeline
(via pyzm's ``Detector`` API), and returns results.

.. _path1_setup:

Path 1: Detection only (no ES)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Requires ZM 1.37+.** ZoneMinder can call ``zm_detect.py`` directly via its
Event Start Command feature — no Event Server needed.

Configure per monitor in ZM: go to the monitor's **Config -> Recording** tab and set:

- **Event Start Command**::

     /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_detect.py -e %EID% -m %MID% -r "%EC%" -n --pyzm-debug

  (``-c`` defaults to ``/etc/zm/objectconfig.yml``; pass it explicitly only if your config is elsewhere.)

ZM substitutes ``%EID%``, ``%MID%``, ``%EC%`` tokens at runtime when an event starts.

Detection results are:

- Written to the ZM event notes (``-n`` flag)
- Saved as ``objdetect.jpg`` and ``objects.json`` in the event folder
  (if ``write_image_to_zm: "yes"`` in ``objectconfig.yml``)
- Optionally tagged in ZM (if ``tag_detected_objects: "yes"``, requires ZM >= 1.37.44)
- Optionally sent as **push notifications** via FCM (if ``push.enabled: "yes"`` in
  ``objectconfig.yml``, requires ZM >= 1.39.2 with the Notifications API)

**What you get:** object/face/ALPR/audio detection, annotated images, detection notes in ZM,
local or remote ML via ``pyzm.serve``, and (optionally) FCM push notifications to
registered devices.

**What you don't get:** WebSocket notifications, MQTT,
notification rules/muting, or the ES control interface.

.. note::

   Push notifications in Path 1 require ZoneMinder 1.39.2+ (which adds the
   ``Notifications`` REST API for token storage). Devices register their FCM tokens
   via the ZM API; ``zm_detect`` reads them via pyzm and sends push notifications
   through an FCM cloud function proxy after detection. See the ``push`` section
   in ``objectconfig.yml`` for configuration.

To set up Path 1, you only need to:

1. Install pyzm and the hooks (see :doc:`install_path1`)
2. Edit ``/etc/zm/objectconfig.yml`` with your ZM portal credentials and desired models
3. Set the **Event Start Command** in the monitor's Config -> Recording tab as shown above
4. Optionally, set **Event End Command** (same tab) to a similar invocation if you want end-of-event processing
5. Optionally, enable push notifications by configuring the ``push`` section in
   ``objectconfig.yml`` (see :ref:`push_config`)

.. _path2_setup:

Path 2: Full Event Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ES is a Perl daemon that monitors ZoneMinder's shared memory for new events,
invokes the ML hooks, and handles push notifications, WebSockets, MQTT, rules, and more.

When an event occurs, the ES invokes ``zm_event_start.sh``, which calls ``zm_detect.py``.
Based on the detection result and your notification settings, the ES sends alerts via
FCM (iOS/Android push), WebSockets, MQTT, and/or third-party push APIs.

**What you get (in addition to Path 1):** push notifications to zmNg/zmNinja and other
FCM clients, WebSocket notifications, MQTT publishing, notification rules (time-based
muting, per-monitor controls), per-device monitor filtering via ``tokens.txt``, and the
ES control interface.

To set up Path 2:

1. Install the ES and its Perl dependencies (see :doc:`install_path2`)
2. Install pyzm and the hooks (see :doc:`install_path1`)
3. Edit ``/etc/zm/zmeventnotification.yml`` and ``/etc/zm/objectconfig.yml``
4. Enable ``OPT_USE_EVENTNOTIFICATION`` in ZM ``Options -> Systems``

See :doc:`principles` for a detailed walkthrough of how the ES processes events.

.. note::

   Do **not** configure both ``EventStartCommand`` (Path 1) and the ES hook (Path 2)
   for the same monitors — you would end up running detection twice on every event.

Manual testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Regardless of which path you use, you can always test detection manually::

   # Test with a ZM event
   sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_detect.py \
       --eventid <eid> --monitorid <mid> --debug

   # Test with a local image file (no ZM event needed)
   sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_detect.py \
       --file /path/to/image.jpg --debug

**Testing push notifications (Direct mode):**

If you have ``push.enabled: "yes"`` in ``objectconfig.yml`` and tokens registered
in the ``Notifications`` table, you can test push delivery from the command line.
Use ``--file`` with ``--eventid`` and ``--monitorid`` to trigger push without a live
event. The ``--fakeit`` flag overrides detection results so you don't need an image
that actually matches your detection pattern::

   sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_detect.py \
       --file /path/to/any/image.jpg --eventid <eid> --monitorid <mid> \
       --debug --fakeit "person"

Replace ``<eid>`` with a real event ID (so the notification links to a viewable event)
and ``<mid>`` with the monitor ID. Registered devices should receive a push notification
within a few seconds. Check the debug output for ``push:`` log lines to verify delivery.

(``--config`` defaults to ``/etc/zm/objectconfig.yml`` and can be omitted if your config is at the standard path.)


Post install steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Make sure you edit your installed ``objectconfig.yml`` to the right
   settings. You MUST change the ``general`` section for your own
   portal.
-  If you use ``zm_event_start.sh`` (Path 2), make sure the ``CONFIG_FILE``
   variable in the script matches your config location. When calling
   ``zm_detect.py`` directly (Path 1), ``-c`` defaults to
   ``/etc/zm/objectconfig.yml``.


Test operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can test detection directly with ``zm_detect.py`` (no need to go through the shell wrapper):

::

    sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_detect.py \
        --eventid <eid> --monitorid <mid> --debug

Replace ``<eid>`` with an actual event ID from your ZM console. The ``<mid>`` is the monitor ID
(optional — if specified, monitor-specific settings from ``objectconfig.yml`` will be used).

You can also test with a local image file instead of a ZM event::

    sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_detect.py \
        --file /path/to/test.jpg --debug

``--config`` defaults to ``/etc/zm/objectconfig.yml``. Pass it explicitly only if your config is elsewhere.

If using the ES hook mode, you can also test the full shell wrapper::

    sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_event_start.sh <eid> <mid>

If it doesn't work, see :doc:`hooks_faq` for debugging steps.


Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~
To upgrade at a later stage, see :ref:`upgrade_es_hooks`.

Sidebar: Local vs. Remote Machine Learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run the machine learning code on a separate server using ``pyzm.serve``
(the built-in remote ML detection server that replaces the legacy ``mlapi``).
This frees up your ZM server resources and keeps models loaded in memory on the GPU box
so subsequent detections are fast. See :ref:`this FAQ entry <local_remote_ml>`.

To start the server on your GPU box::

   pip install pyzm[serve]
   python -m pyzm.serve --models yolo11s --port 5000

Then point ``ml_gateway`` in ``objectconfig.yml`` to that server::

   remote:
     ml_gateway: "http://gpu-box:5000"
     ml_gateway_mode: "url"          # let the server fetch images directly from ZM
     ml_fallback_local: "yes"

Use ``ml_gateway_mode: "url"`` if your GPU box can reach ZoneMinder directly (recommended
for best performance). Use ``"image"`` (default) if the GPU box is on a different network
and can't reach ZM. See :ref:`remote_ml_config` for full details.


.. _supported_models:

Which models should I use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **YOLO ONNX (Recommended)**: The default and recommended model. Uses ONNX format via OpenCV's DNN
  module. Both YOLOv11 and YOLOv26 are supported (both require OpenCV 4.13+).
  Multiple sizes are available for each: ``n`` (nano), ``s`` (small), ``m`` (medium), ``l`` (large)
  — smaller models are faster, larger models are more accurate.
  The default is ``yolo11n`` (nano) which provides a good balance.

- **YOLOv4**: Still supported via Darknet weights. Requires OpenCV 4.4+.

- **Google Coral Edge TPU**: Supported for both object detection and face detection. See install instructions above.

- **YOLOv3 / Tiny YOLOv3 / Tiny YOLOv4**: Still available but no longer installed by default.
  Set the appropriate ``INSTALL_*`` flag to ``yes`` during install if you need them.

- **BirdNET audio recognition**: Identifies 6500+ bird species from audio in ZM events.
  Install via the installer with ``--install-birdnet`` (or ``INSTALL_BIRDNET=yes``),
  or manually: ``/opt/zoneminder/venv/bin/pip install birdnet-analyzer``

- For face recognition, use ``face_model: cnn`` for more accuracy and ``face_model: hog`` for better speed


.. _detection_sequence:

Understanding detection configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain arbitrary detection types (object, face, alpr, audio) and multiple models within
each type. The detection pipeline is configured through two key structures in ``objectconfig.yml``:

- ``ml_sequence`` — specifies the sequence of ML detection steps
- ``stream_sequence`` — specifies frame selection and retry preferences

.. note::

   All configuration is now in YAML format in ``objectconfig.yml``. The old ``{{variable}}``
   template substitution syntax is **no longer supported**. All values must be specified directly
   in the YAML file. The ``use_sequence`` flag no longer exists — the sequence structures are
   always used.

   The only substitution supported is ``${base_data_path}`` which is replaced with the value from
   ``general.base_data_path``.

Per-monitor overrides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to change ``ml_sequence`` or ``stream_sequence`` on a per monitor basis, you can do so
under the ``monitors`` section. You can override the entire structure or just parts of it:

::

   monitors:
     3:
       ml_sequence:
         general:
           model_sequence: "object,face"
         object:
           general:
             pattern: "(person|car)"
     7:
       ml_sequence:
         general:
           model_sequence: "object,alpr"

Per-monitor zones
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can define detection zones per monitor. Each zone specifies a polygon region and optionally
a ``detection_pattern`` (regex of labels to look for in that zone) and an ``ignore_pattern``
(regex of labels to suppress even if they match ``detection_pattern``).

::

   monitors:
     999:
       zones:
         my_driveway:
           coords: "306,356 1003,341 1074,683 154,715"
           detection_pattern: "(person|car)"
           ignore_pattern: "(car|truck)"
         front_porch:
           coords: "0,0 200,300 700,900"

- ``coords`` — polygon coordinates as ``"x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3 ..."``
- ``detection_pattern`` — regex for which labels to accept in this zone (optional; if omitted, all labels match)
- ``ignore_pattern`` — regex for labels to suppress in this zone even if ``detection_pattern`` allows them
  (optional). Useful for excluding parked cars or other stationary objects from a specific area.

You can also import zones from ZoneMinder instead of defining them manually:

::

   general:
     import_zm_zones: "yes"
     only_triggered_zm_zones: "no"



Understanding ml_sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``ml_sequence`` structure lies in the ``ml`` section of ``objectconfig.yml``.
At a high level, this is how it is structured:

::

   ml:
     ml_sequence:
       general:
         model_sequence: "<comma separated detection types>"
       <detection_type>:
         general:
           pattern: "<pattern>"
           same_model_sequence_strategy: "<strategy>"
         sequence:
           - name: "Model name"
             enabled: "yes"
             # ... model-specific parameters ...
           - name: "Another model"
             enabled: "yes"
             # ... model-specific parameters ...

Here is a concrete example from the default ``objectconfig.yml``:

::

   ml:
     ml_sequence:
       general:
         model_sequence: "object,face,alpr,audio"
       object:
         general:
           pattern: "(person|car|motorbike|bus|truck|boat)"
           same_model_sequence_strategy: first
         sequence:
           - name: YOLO ONNX
             enabled: "yes"
             object_weights: "${base_data_path}/models/ultralytics/yolo11n.onnx"
             object_min_confidence: 0.3
             object_framework: opencv
             object_processor: gpu
       face:
         general:
           pattern: ".*"
           same_model_sequence_strategy: union
         sequence:
           - name: DLIB face recognition
             enabled: "yes"
             face_detection_framework: dlib
             known_images_path: "${base_data_path}/known_faces"
             face_model: cnn
       audio:
         general:
           pattern: ".*"
           same_model_sequence_strategy: first
         sequence:
           - name: BirdNET
             enabled: "yes"
             audio_framework: birdnet
             birdnet_min_conf: 0.5

**Explanation:**

- The ``general`` section at the top level specifies characteristics that apply to all elements inside
  the structure.

   - ``model_sequence`` dictates the detection types (comma separated). Example ``object,face,alpr,audio`` will
     first run object detection, then face, then alpr, then audio

- For each detection type in ``model_sequence``, you specify model configurations in the ``sequence`` list.
  Each entry in the sequence is a model configuration with a ``name`` and ``enabled`` flag.

  **Note**: When using ``pyzm.serve`` (remote ML), the ``ml_sequence`` and zone settings from
  ``objectconfig.yml`` are sent along with each detection request.

Leveraging same_model_sequence_strategy and frame_strategy effectively
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When using model chaining, these attributes control how aggressively the pipeline searches for matches.

``same_model_sequence_strategy`` is part of ``ml_sequence``  with the following possible values:

   - ``first`` - When detecting objects, if there are multiple fallbacks, break out the moment we get a match
      using any object detection library (Default)
   - ``most`` - run through all libraries, select one that has most object matches
   - ``most_unique`` - run through all libraries, select one that has most unique object matches
   - ``union`` - run through all libraries, combine all detections from every variant into one merged list.
     Useful when you have multiple models that detect different classes (e.g. a base YOLO model and a
     fine-tuned model) and want to combine their results

``frame_strategy`` is part of ``stream_sequence`` with the following possible values:

   - 'most_models': Match the frame that has matched most models (does not include same model alternatives) (Default)
   - 'first': Stop at first match
   - 'first_new': Like ``first``, but only counts detections that pass past-detection filtering
     (i.e. genuinely new objects, not parked cars already detected in a prior run)
   - 'most': Match the frame that has the highest number of detected objects
   - 'most_unique': Match the frame that has the highest number of unique detected objects

When two frames tie on the primary metric (e.g. same number of detections), the frame with
the higher total confidence sum wins.
           

**A proper example:**

Take a look at `this article <https://medium.com/zmninja/multi-frame-and-multi-model-analysis-533fa1d2799a>`__ for a walkthrough.

**All options:**

``ml_sequence`` supports various other attributes. See the
`pyzm DetectorConfig documentation <https://pyzmv2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/pyzm.html>`__
for the full list of supported keys (``match_past_detections``, ``past_det_max_diff_area``,
``aliases``, ``max_detection_size``, etc.).

Understanding stream_sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``stream_sequence`` structure lies in the ``ml`` section of ``objectconfig.yml``.
At a high level, this is how it is structured:

::

   ml:
     stream_sequence:
       frame_set: "snapshot,alarm"
       frame_strategy: most_models
       contig_frames_before_error: 5
       max_attempts: 3
       sleep_between_attempts: 4
       resize: 800

**Explanation:**

- ``frame_set`` defines the set of frames it should use for analysis (comma separated)
- ``frame_strategy`` defines what it should do when a match has been found
- ``contig_frames_before_error``: How many contiguous errors should occur before giving up on the series of frames 
- ``max_attempts``: How many times to try each frame (before counting it as an error in the ``contig_frames_before_error`` count)
- ``sleep_between_attempts``: When an error is encountered, how many seconds to wait for retrying 
- ``resize``: what size to resize frames too (useful if you want to speed things up and/or are running out of memory)

**A proper example:**

Take a look at `this article <https://medium.com/zmninja/multi-frame-and-multi-model-analysis-533fa1d2799a>`__ for a walkthrough.

**All options:**

``stream_sequence`` supports various other attributes. See the
`pyzm StreamConfig documentation <https://pyzmv2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/pyzm.html>`__
for the full list (``max_frames``, ``start_frame``, ``frame_skip``, ``save_frames``, etc.).


How ml_sequence and stream_sequence work together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The combined logic works as follows:

::

   for each frame in stream sequence:
      perform stream_sequence actions on each frame
      for each model_sequence in ml_options:
      if detected, use frame_strategy (in stream_sequence) to decide if we should try other model sequences
         perform general actions:
            for each model_configuration in ml_options.sequence:
               detect()
               if detected, use same_model_sequence_strategy to decide if we should try other model configurations
      

.. _remote_ml_config:

Using the remote ML detection server (pyzm.serve)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   ``pyzm.serve`` replaces the legacy ``mlapi`` server. It is built into pyzm itself,
   uses the same ``Detector`` API, and requires no separate configuration file. The old
   ``mlapiconfig.ini`` is no longer needed.

**Server setup** (GPU box)::

   pip install pyzm[serve]

   # Basic usage
   python -m pyzm.serve --models yolo11s --port 5000

   # With authentication
   python -m pyzm.serve --models yolo11s --port 5000 \
       --auth --auth-user admin --auth-password secret

   # Multiple models, GPU inference
   python -m pyzm.serve --models yolo11s yolo26s --port 5000 --processor gpu

**Client setup** (``objectconfig.yml`` on the ZM box)::

   remote:
     ml_gateway: "http://192.168.1.183:5000"
     ml_gateway_mode: "image"       # "image" (default) or "url"
     ml_fallback_local: "yes"
     ml_user: "!ML_USER"
     ml_password: "!ML_PASSWORD"
     ml_timeout: 60

When ``ml_gateway`` is set, ``zm_detect.py`` creates the ``Detector`` in remote mode.
The server keeps models loaded in memory so subsequent requests skip the expensive
model-load step.

If the remote server is unreachable and ``ml_fallback_local`` is ``yes``, detection
falls back to running locally on the ZM box.

All other settings (``ml_sequence``, ``stream_sequence``, monitor overrides, animation,
image writing, etc.) stay in ``objectconfig.yml`` — there is no second config file to manage.

**Two detection modes:**

Image mode (``ml_gateway_mode: "image"``, default)
   Frame extraction happens locally on the ZM box, then each frame is JPEG-encoded and
   uploaded to the server's ``/detect`` endpoint. This works universally but transfers
   every frame through the ZM box.

URL mode (``ml_gateway_mode: "url"``)
   The ZM box sends frame URLs (e.g. ``https://zm/index.php?view=image&eid=123&fid=snapshot``)
   and ZM auth credentials to the server's ``/detect_urls`` endpoint. The **server** fetches
   images directly from ZoneMinder and runs detection. This is more efficient when the GPU box
   has fast/direct network access to ZM, since frames don't have to pass through the ZM box
   as an intermediary.

   To use URL mode, the server must be able to reach your ZM web portal over HTTP/HTTPS.

**Server endpoints:**

- ``GET /health`` — returns ``{"status": "ok", "models_loaded": true}``
- ``POST /detect`` — (image mode) accepts multipart ``file`` (JPEG) + optional ``zones`` (JSON)
- ``POST /detect_urls`` — (URL mode) accepts JSON with frame URLs, auth token, and optional zones
- ``POST /login`` — (auth mode only) accepts ``{"username": ..., "password": ...}``, returns JWT token

Here is a part of my config, for example:

::

   general:
     import_zm_zones: "yes"

   monitors:
     3:
       # doorbell
       ml_sequence:
         general:
           model_sequence: "object,face"
         object:
           general:
             pattern: "(person|monitor_doorbell)"
     7:
       # Driveway
       ml_sequence:
         general:
           model_sequence: "object,alpr"
         object:
           general:
             pattern: "(person|car|motorbike|bus|truck|boat)"
     2:
       # Front lawn
       ml_sequence:
         general:
           model_sequence: "object"
         object:
           general:
             pattern: "(person)"
     4:
       # deck
       ml_sequence:
         object:
           general:
             pattern: "(person|monitor_deck)"
       stream_sequence:
         frame_strategy: most_models
         frame_set: "alarm"
         contig_frames_before_error: 5
         max_attempts: 3
         sleep_between_attempts: 4
         resize: 800

About specific detection types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

License plate recognition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three ALPR options are provided: 

- `Plate Recognizer <https://platerecognizer.com>`__ . Uses a deep learning model that provides more accurate results than OpenALPR in my testing. Requires a license key (a `free tier <https://platerecognizer.com/pricing/>`__ is available with 2500 lookups per month).
- `OpenALPR <https://www.openalpr.com>`__ . While OpenALPR's detection is not as good as Plate Recognizer, when it does detect, it provides a lot more information (like car make/model/year etc.)
- `OpenALPR command line <http://doc.openalpr.com/compiling.html>`__. This is a basic version of OpenALPR that can be self compiled and executed locally. It is far inferior to the cloud services and does NOT use any form of deep learning. However, it is free, and if you have a camera that has a good view of plates, it will work.

``alpr_service`` defined the service to be used.

Face Dection & Recognition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When it comes to faces, there are two aspects (that many often confuse):

- Detecting a Face
- Recognizing a Face 

Face Detection 
'''''''''''''''
If you only want "face detection", you can use either dlib/face_recognition or Google's TPU. Both are supported.
Take a look at ``objectconfig.yml`` for how to set them up.

Face Detection + Face Recognition
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Face Recognition uses
`this <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition>`__ library. Before
you try and use face recognition, please make sure you did a
``/opt/zoneminder/venv/bin/pip install face_recognition`` The reason this is not
automatically done during setup is that it installs a lot of
dependencies that takes time (including dlib) and not everyone wants it.

.. sidebar:: Face recognition limitations

        Overhead cameras will not work well. This library requires a
        reasonable face orientation (works for front facing, or somewhat side
        facing poses) and does not work for full profiles or completely overhead
        faces. Take a look at the `accuracy
        wiki <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/wiki/Face-Recognition-Accuracy-Problems>`__
        of this library to know more about its limitations. Note that ``cnn`` mode is significantly more accurate than ``hog`` mode, but comes with a speed and memory tradeoff.

Using the right face recognition modes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Face recognition uses dlib. Note that in ``objectconfig.yml`` you have two options of face detection/recognition. Dlib has two modes of operation (controlled by ``face_model``). Face recognition works in two steps:
  - A: Detect a face
  - B: Recognize a face

``face_model`` affects step A. If you use ``cnn`` as a value, it will use a DNN to detect a face. If you use ``hog`` as a value, it will use a much faster method to detect a face. ``cnn`` is *much* more accurate in finding faces than ``hog`` but much slower. In my experience, ``hog`` works ok for front faces while ``cnn`` detects profiles/etc as well. 

Step B kicks in only after step A succeeds (i.e. a face has been detected). The algorithm used there is common irrespective of whether you found a face via ``hog`` or ``cnn``.

Configuring face recognition directories
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Make sure you have images of people you want to recognize in
   ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification/known_faces``
- You can have multiple faces per person
- Typical configuration:

:: 

  known_faces/
    +----------bruce_lee/
                +------1.jpg
                +------2.jpg
    +----------david_gilmour/
            +------1.jpg
            +------img2.jpg
            +------3.jpg
    +----------ramanujan/
            +------face1.jpg
            +------face2.jpg


In this example, you have 3 names, each with different images.

- It is recommended that you now train the images by doing:

::

  sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_train_faces.py


If you find yourself running out of memory while training, use the size argument like so:

::

     sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_train_faces.py --size 800

   
   
- Note that you do not necessarily have to train it first but I highly recommend it. 
  When detection runs, it will look for the trained file and if missing, will auto-create it. 
  However, detection may also load yolo and if you have limited GPU resources, you may run out of memory when training. 

-  When face recognition is triggered, it will load each of these files
   and if there are faces in them, will load them and compare them to
   the alarmed image

known faces images
''''''''''''''''''
-  Make sure the face is recognizable
-  crop it to around 800 pixels width (doesn't seem to need bigger
   images, but experiment. Larger the image, the larger the memory
   requirements)
- crop around the face - not a tight crop, but no need to add a full body. A typical "passport" photo crop, maybe with a bit more of shoulder is ideal.


Audio Recognition (BirdNET)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BirdNET identifies 6500+ bird species from audio extracted from ZoneMinder events.
It uses the `BirdNET-Analyzer <https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer>`__ deep learning
model. Audio is extracted from the event video, split into 3-second chunks, and each chunk
is analyzed for bird species. The best confidence per species across all chunks is reported.

**Installation:**

BirdNET is not installed by default. Use the installer flag::

   sudo -H ./install.sh --install-birdnet

Or install manually into the venv::

   /opt/zoneminder/venv/bin/pip install birdnet-analyzer

**Configuration** (in ``objectconfig.yml``):

1. Add ``audio`` to your ``model_sequence``::

      ml_sequence:
        general:
          model_sequence: "object,face,alpr,audio"

2. Configure the ``audio`` section::

      audio:
        general:
          pattern: ".*"
          same_model_sequence_strategy: first
        sequence:
          - name: BirdNET
            enabled: "yes"
            audio_framework: birdnet
            birdnet_min_conf: 0.5
            birdnet_lat: -1
            birdnet_lon: -1
            birdnet_sensitivity: 1.0
            birdnet_overlap: 0.0

**Parameters:**

- ``birdnet_min_conf`` — minimum confidence threshold (0.0–1.0). Default: 0.5
- ``birdnet_lat``, ``birdnet_lon`` — latitude/longitude for seasonal species filtering.
  Set to your location to restrict predictions to species expected in your area at the
  current time of year. -1 disables location filtering (all 6500+ species considered).
  If set to -1 but the ZM monitor has lat/lon in the database, those values are used
  as a fallback.
- ``birdnet_sensitivity`` — sigmoid sensitivity (higher = more sensitive, more false positives). Default: 1.0
- ``birdnet_overlap`` — overlap in seconds between consecutive 3-second audio chunks (0.0–2.9). Default: 0.0

**Notes:**

- Audio detection only runs on monitors that have audio recording enabled in ZoneMinder.
- Unlike image-based detections, audio detections do not have spatial bounding boxes
  (a dummy 1×1 box is used internally).
- BirdNET results appear in event notes alongside object/face/ALPR detections.
- The ``pattern`` regex in the ``audio`` general section filters species names,
  e.g. ``pattern: "(Robin|Sparrow)"`` to only report specific species.
