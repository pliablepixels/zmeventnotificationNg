What is the Event Server and the ML Ecosystem?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The **Event Notification Server (ES)** is a companion daemon for
`ZoneMinder <https://zoneminder.com>`__. It monitors ZoneMinder's shared
memory for new events and can push real-time notifications to clients via
WebSockets, FCM (push to iOS/Android), and MQTT. It also supports
per-monitor notification rules, time-based muting, and integration with
`zmNinjaNG <https://zmninjang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ (the
newer-generation app for ZoneMinder).

The **ML Ecosystem** (``zm_detect.py + pyzmNg``) is the machine learning detection
framework. They take a ZoneMinder event and run it through one or more
ML pipelines — supporting multiple model types (object, face, ALPR, etc.).
The ML hook is powered by `pyzmNg <https://pyzmng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`__,
a standalone ML detection library that can also be used independently.

The ES and the hook can be used together or separately, as described below.

Choose your setup
+++++++++++++++++

There are two ways to use ML-powered object detection with ZoneMinder:

.. topic:: Path 1: Detection + optional push (no ES)

   Wire ``zm_detect.py`` directly to ZoneMinder using ``EventStartCommand``
   (requires ZM 1.38.1+). ZM calls the detection script automatically when
   an event starts. No daemon needed — simpler to set up. Can optionally
   send FCM push notifications directly (requires ZM 1.39.2+).
   See :doc:`guides/install_path1` for setup instructions.

.. topic:: Path 2: Full Event Server

   Install and run the Event Notification Server alongside ZoneMinder. The ES
   detects new events via shared memory, invokes the ML hooks, and handles
   push notifications, WebSockets, MQTT, rules, and more.
   See :doc:`guides/install_path2` for setup instructions.

.. include:: guides/_feature_table.rst

If you only need detection results written to your ZM events (with optional push
notifications), Path 1 is simpler to set up.
If you need WebSocket notifications, MQTT, notification rules, or the ES control
interface, you need Path 2.

See the :doc:`guides/installation` page for step-by-step setup instructions for either path.
